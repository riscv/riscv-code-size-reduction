This document describes the `Zce` extension to reduce code-size.

[NOTE]

  This document is in a *stable* state but will certainly change before ratification.

== Spec update history

|===================================================================
| version | change
| 0.41.6  | simplify c.mva01s07 assembler syntax, and fix encoding in table 16 (it was inconsistent)
|         | fix ZCE-type format for 32-bit PUSH/POP (no actual spec change)
| 0.41.5  | remove # from c.tblj* assembly syntax, as it's a comment character
| 0.41.4  | correct table 30 so that the C.LB/C.LH encodings are in tyhe 001____10 group (the spec was inconsistent)
| 0.41.3  | remove requirement that writing to xTBLJALVEC flushes the jump table cache - just use FENCE.I or other standard mechanism
|         | change pseudo-code for POP so that the return value can be interrupted / repeated
|         | beq/bne assembly example should have been beqi/bnei
| 0.41.2  | bug fix: PUSH/PUSH.E were missing the `areg` field which controls wether the PUSH moves a[i] into s[i]
| 0.41.1  | bug fix: move PUSH/POP/POPRET to custom-1 as they were overlapping (so will have to change again in the future)
| 0.41    | bug fix: change MULI encoding, as it overlapped with SLLI (it's now in custom-0, so will have to change again in the future)
|         | bug fix: C.TBLJ and C.TBLJALM were reserved in the encoding table and example usage
|         | add compiler switches for the prototype compiler
| 0.40    | *Stable version for toolchain/simulator prototyping*
|         | Split C.TBLJAL into C.TBLJ, C,TBLJAL, C.TBLJALM. The encoding is the same, the link register is chosen based on the table index.
| 0.34    | Update encodings as requested by John Hauser for 16-bit encodings 
|         | Update C.TBLJAL encoding
|         | Change C.PUSH etc encodings, and adjust register lists and spimm ranges. No change to 32-bit encodings.
|         | Put BEQI/BNEI in the BRANCH major opcode with funct3=01x, update branch offset range and make comparison immediate unsigned
|         | Reinstate C.MVA01S07 (will get renamed at some point)
|         | remove MULIW, ADDIADD*, MULIADD*, change encoding for MULI
|         | Add C.LB, C.LH
|         | Remove LWTP/SWTP/LDTP/SDTP
|         | remove TBLJAL - 0.01% benefit occasionally
|         | Mark DECBNEZ as "limited value" - we may well remove it in the future
| 0.33    | s0 as a return value is UNSAFE for pop/popret, as the sequence is not restartable. Only returning constant values 0/1/-1 (only 0 for C.POPRET)
|         | Simplify PUSH/POP/POPRET to remove ra option (very rare not to include ra)
|         | Increase PUSH/C.PUSH embedded moves to include a3, and make them consistent with between PUSH and C.PUSH (PUSH has the option not to do any so as not to waste performance).
|         | John Hauser feedback: Update encodings for C.SB/C.SH/C.LBU/C.LHU/C.DECBNEZ
|         | *Warning* C.PUSH/C.POP/C.POPRET encodings will change in the next revision
| 0.32    | Replace DECBGEZ with DECBNEZ as it's better for the compiler
|         | For C.PUSH/C.POPRET change register list to include s7 instead of s8 as it greatly reduces the number of wasted load/stores (16% for debian, 4% for the other benchmarks) and has no effect on code-size
|         | Fix POP/POPRET pseudo-code - it was doing "mv a0, s0" _after_ "ld s0,sp(n)" instead of before so the return value would have been wrong
|         | for C.POPRET change ret_val to only be "mv a0, s0" not "mv a0, 0" as s0 is more commonly used
|         | For PUSH also allow "mv s3, a3" up to "mv s6, a6", I'd forgotten to allocate 4 encodings
|         | For C.PUSH increase the embedded moves to include s3 to improve the code-size reduction.
|         | tighten up the Memory[] used in the semantics to specify that it's XLEN bits wide, and whether it's Instruction or Data memory as the endianness handling may be different (according to Allen Baum)
| 0.31    | Fix Allen Baum's feedback including removing Zba/Zbb requirement and making them a recommendation only. There's no written policy requiring 32-bit versions of 16-bit encodings as far as I know, and we're not planning to fully benchmark Zba/Zbb for code-size.
| 0.30    | careful proofreading and updated C.POP encoding for simpler decode
|===================================================================

== Issues

* `BEQI/BNEI` should have `nzuimm` instead of `uimm`, will fix after prototyping phase
* `MULI` has a temporary encoding
* should the fault handling in `push/pop/popret` be profile defined, or is platform defined ok?
* is a hypervisor version of `xTBLJALVEC` required for `tbljal`?
* `xTBLJALVEC` need addresses to be allocated
* EABI spec is not frozen - so it's not clear which formats of PUSH.E etc that I need
** currently s4 is the maximum EABI saved register, which doesn't match a 16-bit format register list (which end at s3, s5, s7, s11) I'd prefer it if the register lists match for the UABI and EABI for a simpler spec.
* May need an EABI version of `C.MVA01S07`

== `Zce` configurations

image::https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/ISA%20proposals/Huawei/Zce_subsets%20simplified5.png[Zce subsets]

`Zce` is split into two main subsets

* `Zcea` which is compatible with all existing standard extensions designed for small embedded cores
** `Zcee` is a simpler subset of `Zcea` for high performance cores, it can be implemented without the rest of `Zcea`
* `Zceb` reuses encoding from the `D`-extension, and so is incompatible with `D`
** `Zceb` is fully compatible with `Zdinx`

[NOTE]

  To get 32-bit versions of the instructions from `Zcee` the `B`-extension subsets `Zba` and `Zbb` should be implemented. This is recommended but not required by this specification.

|===============================================================================

`Zcea/Zceb` are compatible with both the `I` and `E` extensions. 

All systems which implement `Zcea/Zceb` must also implement the `C` extension. 

If `M` or `Zmmul` is specified then `Zcea` also includes the `C.MUL, MULI` instructions.

== C-extension subsets

The C-extension already reuses encodings between different architectures. `Zce` extends this concept further. <<zce_quad0>>, <<zce_quad1>> and <<zce_quad2>> show how each encoding is allocated for different architectures or for different combinations of extensions.

For example:

* `C.FSD`, `C.SQ`, and `{C.LBU, C.SB}` share opcodes, so for different configurations the encodings represent:
** `C.FSD` for `RV32CD/RV64CD`
** `C.SQ`  for `RV128C`
** `{C.LBU, C.SB}` for `RV32C_Zceb, RV64C_Zceb， RV32C_Zceb_Zdinx, RV64C_Zceb_Zdinx`
** illegal encoding for `RV32C, RV64C`, as neither `D` nor `Zce` was specified

The shared encoding column in the tables assigns an arbitrary number to show which encodings are grouped together (I can't find a better way of highlighting groups of cells in the table in adoc format). `Zce` instructions are in *bold*.

[NOTE]

  The names `Zci, Zcf, Zcd, Zcq, Zc32, Zc64, Zc128` are not official subset names, I have used them to help explain how the 16-bit encoding space is divided up and reused.

=== C.SEXT.W

`C.SEXT.W` is added as a pseudo-instruction for `C.ADDIW rd, 0`

=== C.MVA01S07

Register moves are the most common in GCC output in both the benchmark suite and the Debian distro. This instruction combines very common pairs of moves into a single 16-bit encoding:

* move from two `s[0-7]` registers into `a0` and `a1`.

Similar to `PUSH/POP` this instruction uses ABI names for the registers. The mapping from `s` to `x` number is simple. For `RV32_Zdinx` a paired register write port is required already. For other configurations the microarchitecture can:

* split the instructions into an uninterruptable sequence of two `mv` instructions to avoid the second write port
* add a paired write port for `a0` and `a1` only. Because the instruction only writes these two registers, only one paired write port is needed. This is much cheaper than allowing paired writes to the whole register file.

[NOTE]

  Combining a2 and a3 into a double move isn't beneficial enough in general to include in the ISA

[NOTE]

  We may need an EABI version of this instruction. TBD.

[NOTE]

  There is no 32-bit instruction, because a 32-bit form would add no value.

Mapping from the `s` register number to the `x` register index is simple for the UABI:

[source,sourceCode,text]

//000 (s0) -> 01000 (x8)
//001 (s1) -> 01001 (x9)

//011 (s3) -> 10011 (x19)
// ...         ...

//verilog syntax for concatenation of bits
xreg[4:0] = {sreg[2:1]>0,sreg[2:1]==0,sreg[2:0]};

=== B-extension recommended subsets for code-size reduction

The 32-bit encodings for `Zcee` (see <<mon-32bit>>) are in `Zba` and `Zbb`.

It is recommended to implement both `Zba` and `Zbb` for code-size reduction, but not required by `Zce`. They contain useful instructions for example:

. `Zba` includes `sh[123]add` which are used for address calculations.

. `Zbb` includes rotate (`rori, ror, rol`), byte reverse (`rev8`) and count-leading-zeroes (`clz`).

== `Zceb` definition

`Zceb` and the `D`-extension use the same encodings, therefore the two cannot co-exist and would be an illegal RISC-V configuration.

`Zceb` is compatible with `Zdinx`.

=== Decrement and branch

[[decbr16]]
==== C.DECBNEZ

This instruction conflicts with the `D`-extension. If `D` is implemented, this instruction will not be available. It is compatible with `ZDinx`.

This instruction is a combined decrement and branch, used for inferring loops with an optionally scaled loop counter.

[NOTE]

  The 16 and 32-bit forms of this instruction need a new relocation type in the toolchain.

[NOTE]

  The 32-bit encoding has a signed offset. The 16-bit encoding has an unsigned offset, but it can only represent a backwards jump. 
  Therefore to be legal syntax for the 16-bit encoding the offset is specified as a negative number but encoded as a positive offset.
 
[NOTE]

  The encoding is reserved if the offset is zero.

=== LWGP, SWGP, LDGP, SDGP

These instructions conflict with the `D`-extension. If `D` is implemented, these instruction will not be available. They are compatible with `Zdinx`.

These instructions reuse the encodings for `FLD/FSD`.

`LWGP,SWGP` give a larger offset range than the standard `LW, SW` instructions by making the base register explicitly `gp`, allowing a 16-bit/64KB range of word aligned offsets, instead of a 12-bit/4KB range of byte aligned offsets.

`LDGP,SDGP` require double word alignment, and so have an increased range of 17-bit/128KB offsets relative to `gp`.

[NOTE]

   Restrictions in the GCC toolchain mean that the full range of `gp` cannot be used for the standard `LW/SW` instructions, in case linker relaxation means that the `gp` relative addresses moves out of range. This will still be the case with `LWGP, SWGP` but the range is so much larger that the impact will be minimal. https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/issues/497[See this github issue]. This issue means that with the current RISC-V ISA the full 4KB range cannot be accessed using `gp` using GCC so the benefit is lower than might be expected.

[#tablejump]
== Table Jump 

Table jumps are used to reduce the code size of `JAL` / `AUIPC+JALR` / `JR` / `AUIPC+JR` instructions.

=== Rationale

Function calls and jumps to fixed labels typically take 32-bit or 64-bit instruction sequences.
Here's an example from the Huawei IoT code, GCC output:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
00e084be <vsprintf>:

  e084da:	19630067            jr	  406(t1) # 100066c <__riscv_restore_0>
----

using `C.TBLJ*` we can reduce this as follows (accepting gaps in the PCs as code has been deleted)

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
00e084be <vsprintf>:
  e084be:	<16-bit>            tbljalm x ;#<mapped to __riscv_save_0>, saving 6-bytes
  
  e084c6:	86b2                mv     a3,a2
  e084c8:	862e                mv     a2,a1
  e084ca:	800005b7            lui	   a1,0x80000

  e084d2:	<16-bit>            tbljal y ;#<mapped to vsnprintf>, saving 2-bytes (8-byte refs to this fn also exist)
  
  e084da:	<16-bit>            tblj   z ;#<mapped to __riscv_restore_0>
----

The principle is to have a single lookup table of `TBLJALENTRIES` addresses for `C.TBLJ*`, which is built by the linker. The linker then substitutes the code as shown in the example above where the 32-byte function is reduced to 18-bytes giving ~ 56% saving. Clearly the lookup table takes some space, but this is a minimal overhead for repeated functions such as the save/restore routines. 

`TBLJALENTRIES` is set by the maximum size of the table, which is 256 as the encoding has an 8-bit index.

Table jump allows the linker to:

* replace 32-bit `J` calls with `C.TBLJ`
* replace 32-bit `JAL ra` calls with `C.TBLJAL`
* replace 32-bit `JAL t0` calls with `C.TBLJALM` (`M` for Millicode)
* replace 64-bit `AUIPC/JR` calls to fixed locations with `C.TBLJ`
* replace 64-bit `AUIPC/JALR ra` calls to fixed locations with `C.TBLJAL`
* replace 64-bit `AUIPC/JALR t0` calls to fixed locations with `C.TBLJALM`
** The `AUIPC+JR/JALR` sequence is used because the offset from the PC is out of the ±1MB range.

=== Encoding

These instructions use a previously reserved encoding.

|==================================================================================================================

[NOTE]

  Other assembler syntaxes are possible such as including the c. prefix 

Therefore there is a single jump table in memory. The table entry number is from the `index8` field in the encoding, which controls the link register.

* `C.TBLJALM`: entries 0-7,    link to `t0`
* `C.TBLJ`   : entries 8-63,   link to `zero`
* `C.TBLJAL` : entries 64-255, link to `ra`

Note that the LSB of every jump table entry is _ignored_ which matches standard `JALR` behaviour.

[#configuringthejumptable]
=== Recommended algorithm for allocating entries in the jump table

Calls to each function are categorised as shown in <<tbljalsavings>>.

.C.TBLJAL/TBJAL code size saving per function
[width="100%",options=header]
|=======================================================================================================================
| original sequence | `C.TBLJ*` saving

| `AUIPC+JALR t0`   | F*6-(XLEN/8) bytes 
|=======================================================================================================================

[NOTE]

  `C.JAL` is not included as there's no code-size saving for RV32 and it's not available for RV64

Each function is called by using one of the three link registers. The total saving per function is calculated by looking at all the times it is called, as follows:
[source,sourceCode,text]
----
saving_per_function_c_tblj    = A * 2 + B * 6 - 2*(XLEN-8)
saving_per_function_c_tbljal  = C * 2 + D * 6 - 2*(XLEN-8)
saving_per_function_c_tbljalm = E * 2 + F * 6 - 2*(XLEN-8)
----

The functions are sorted so that the one with the highest saving is in table entry 0, the second highest in entry 1 etc. for that encoding.

[NOTE]

  This algorithm assumes that each function is only called with one link register.

This allows the core to cache the most frequent targets by caching the lowest numbered entries of each section of the jump table. Only caching a few entries will greatly improve the performance.

=== CSRs

The following set of CSRs is required to control the jump table. 

[NOTE]

  The addresses are for custom CSRs, correct CSR addresses need to be specified.

[#xTBLJALVEC-table]
.`xTBLJALVEC` definition
[width="100%",options=header]
|============================================================================================================
|Address |XLEN-1:6       |5:2   | 1: 0  | CSR        | Permissions | Status

|  0xbc0 |base[XLEN-1:6] |scale | mode  | STBLJALVEC | MRW         | Required if S-mode is implemented
|  0x800 |base[XLEN-1:6] |scale | mode  | UTBLJALVEC | MRW         | Optional
|============================================================================================================

* M-mode always uses `MTBLJALVEC.base`
* S-mode always uses `STBLJALVEC.base`
* U-mode uses `UTBLJALVEC.base` if implemented, otherwise `STBLJALVEC.base` if implemented, otherwise `MTBLJALVEC.base`

`xTBLJALVEC.base` is a virtual address, whenever virtual memory is enabled (i.e. S and U-modes only if implemented and enabled).

Using `xTBLJALVEC.base` in the pseudo code below implicitly assumes that `xTBLJALVEC.base[5:0]=0`. This is consistent with the description of `xTVEC` in the Unprivileged ISA manual.

`xTBLJALVEC.base` is naturally aligned for all legal values of `XLEN`.

The memory pointed to by `xTBLJALVEC.base` only requires eXecute permission. Read/Write access is not required once the jump table/vector table has been configured.

[#xTBLJALVEC-mode-table]
.`xTBLJALVEC.mode` definition
[width="100%",options=header]
|=============================================================================================
| Mode | Comment
| 00   | Jump table mode
| 01   | *reserved for <<vector-table-mode>>*
| 10   | *reserved for <<emulation-mode>>*
| 11   | *reserved*
|=============================================================================================

`xTBLJALVEC.mode` is a WARL field, so can only be programmed to modes which are implemented. Therefore the discovery mechanism is to attempt to program different modes and read back the values to see which are available. Jump table mode _must_ be implemented.

`xTBLJALVEC.scale` is also WARL, and reads as zero. It is reserved for Vector Table Mode, see <<vector-table-mode>>.

=== Jump table mode

In jump table mode the behaviour is to load the target address from `xTBLJALVEC.base` with an offset which is `XLEN/8` times the parameter passed to the instruction.

The actual functions are not moved in memory, the jump table lookup is only to give a reference to them using a 16-bit encoding.

Jump table mode is easy to implement in the linker and doesn't affect the compiler as it is only a link time optimisation.

==== Exceptions for jump table mode

The jump table address can cause instruction fetch errors, such as page faults. In these cases `MEPC` is set to the PC of the `C.TBLJ*` instruction and `MTVAL` is set to the address in the jump table entry.

==== Context Switching for jump table mode

The `xTBLJALVEC` CSRs form part of the current context, and so will need to be saved and restored. It is also possible for the jump table to have a single configuration for all contexts, but in general `xTBLJALVEC` is considered part of the context.

==== Caching for jump table mode

For improved performance, the implementation may cache the contents of the jump table. To maintain coherency between stores to the jump table and the instruction fetch, then a `FENCE.I` is required, or other standard coherency mechanism as defined by RISC-V. More generally, any jump table cache should be flushed whenever the instruction cache is flushed.

[#vector-table-mode]
=== Future Mode: Vector table mode (not for RVM22/RVA22)

Vector table mode is very similar to vectored interrupt handling. The target address is a scaled offset from the base vector. Therefore in vector table mode, execution passes directly to the scaled offset from the base register, not via a jump table.

Vector table mode is similar to the mechanism for the interrupt handler vector. The jump is direct to the destination. However the compiler would have to be aware as it will have to try to fit functions into the table, as each entry is a fixed size so it's not so obviously implementable in the toolchain. We may find other reasons for having this mode. TBD.

`xTBLJALVEC.scale` controls the scale. It is a read/write field instead of WARL.

[width="40%",options=header]
|==================================================================
|`xTBLJALVEC.scale`| `tablescale` 
| 0                | 8-bytes
| 1                | 16-bytes
| 2                | 32-bytes
2+| .....
| 9                | 4096-bytes to match minimum TLB page size
| 10+              | *reserved*
|==================================================================

Note that `tablescale = 1<<(xTBLJALVEC.scale+3)`

==== vector table code

Because this method doesn't have the jump table - the code is actually placed in the table. If the code is too large to fit then it will have to call a routine outside the table, or use more than one entry which invalidates one or more table entries.
This avoids an additional redirection to get to the actual code, assuming the whole body of the code actually fits in the table.

Setting `xTBLJALVEC.scale` to specific values does not set a requirement on the alignment of `xTBLJALVEC.base`. For example if `tablescale=4096`, `xTBLJALVEC.base` does _not_ need to be 4096-byte aligned. 

If `tablescale` is set to 4096 then this allows each entry in the table to be owned by different privilege domain, which can manange its own code. `xTBLJALVEC` must be changed by machine mode only so as the table refers to the system as a whole.

In a way this approach is similar to a *flash patch* mechanism, where the code can be patched by replacing an instruction with a `C.TBLJALM` instruction to call an alternative routine to fix a bug, or add functionality. Although this requires write permission on the code area so cannot work on a boot ROM for example, but it can form the basis of such a mechanism.

For the `vsprintf` example above `riscv_save_0` / `riscv_restore_0` each take 12 bytes, and `xTBLJALVEC.scale=1` (16 bytes per entry) so the actual code is placed in the table. `vsprintf` is 136 bytes, but will shrink to 128-bytes or smaller by use of `c.tbljal` so I have allocated 4 entries to it.

[NOTE]

  This mode may waste memory as the target functions are very unlikely to all be multiples of `tablescale`.

==== Vector Mode Security (future ideas)

The vector mode mechanism could be reused for security in the future. It is possible to define that the memory allocated to to the table can only have entry points on the specific vectors, and also only from `C.TBLJ*` instructions. In this way sensitive code can be placed in the table which cannot be reused for ROP/JOP gadgets, because the code cannot be targetted by `JALR` instructions.

These ideas will not be pursued as part of the code size work.

[[emulation-mode]]
=== Future Mode: Emulation Mode (not for RVM22/RVA22)

Emulation mode is the simplest. It doesn't have a jump table or vector table, so allow a minimal hardware implementation.
It relies on the values in temporary registers not being maintained across function calls.

_There are concerns about overwriting the temporary registers so this may be rejected_

----

The prologue / epilogue reduce from 28-bytes in the original code, to 14-bytes with `-msave-restore`, and to to 8-bytes with `PUSH, POP, POPRET`, which will also improve the performance.
  
[NOTE]

  The calls to `<riscv_save_0>/<riscv_restore_0>` become 64-bit when the target functions are out of the ±1MB range, increasing the prologue/epilogue size to 22-bytes.

[NOTE]

  The `C.PUSH` has an additional register move included `mv s2, a2` which wasn't in the original prologue. This is included to simplify the encoding and definition of `C.PUSH/PUSH` and will cost some performance.

=== UABI and EABI support

The UABI is available on all RVI cores. The EABI is optional on RV32I and required on RV32E.

The UABI supports saved registers `s0-s11`, the EABI supports saved registers `s0-s4` only but `s2-s4` are mapped to _different_ `X` registers.

Therefore encodings which support register lists which include up to `s1` can be used for both ABIs. As soon as the list includes `s2` then a different encoding is required.

This specification for the EABI is taken from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-eabi-spec/blob/master/EABI.adoc[this document].

The `PUSH/POP/POPRET/C.PUSH/C.POP/C.POPRET` instructions support the UABI. The `PUSH.E/POP.E/POPRET.E/C.PUSH.E/C.POP.E/C.POPRET.E` instructions support the EABI.

Where the `X` register list is the same for both ABIs the EABI version is a pseudo-instruction, where the `X` register list is different it has a different encoding, for example: 

* `c.pop.e {ra, s0}, 32` is a pseudo-instruction for `c.pop {ra, s0}, 32`
* `c.pop.e {ra, s0-s2}, 32` has a different encoding to `c.pop {ra, s0-s2}, 32`

It is recommended that:

* when compiling/disassembling for the UABI, the pseudo-instructions with the `.E` suffix _should not_ be used.
* when compiling/disassembling for the EABI, the pseudo-instructions with the `.E` suffix _should_ be used.

The `.E` forms are not available on RV64I or RV128I. Any encodings with a `.E` suffix are reserved on those base architectures.

[#ABI-on-base-arch]
.ABIs on different base architectures
[width="100%",options=header]
|=========================================================================================================================
| Base architecture | UABI | EABI | Notes
| RV32I             | ✓    | ✓   | Full support of both ABIs required
| RV32E             |       | ✓   | Binary can execute on RV32I
| RV64I/RV128I      | ✓    |      | No EABI support on RV64I/RV128I
|=========================================================================================================================

Code compiled for RV32I may be compiled for the UABI or EABI. Code compiled for RV32E may be executed on an RV32I core. 

[NOTE]

  An RV32I core running the EABI has many saved registers. The `PUSH/POP` encodings only support up to `s4`. There are no encodings which support saving higher numbered `s` registers in this case, and so the optimal solution would be for a reduced version of `-msave-restore` which is used for longer register lists. A future version of `Zce` may include new cases in the 32-bit encodings to save the higher `s` registers. At the timing of writing the EABI specification is not frozen and there is no toolchain publicly available so the distribution of higher numbered saved registers for RV32I EABI cannot be assessed.

=== Assembler Syntax

. The `PUSH` instruction 
** pushes(stores)  the registers specified in `reg_list` to the stack
** if `areg_list` is included, moves the registers in the `areg_list` into `s` registers
*** `areg_list` is determined automatically from `rlist`, it cannot be arbitrarily specified. The definition is in <<pushpop32bitsyntax>>.
** adjusts the stack pointer by the `stack_adjustment` 

. The `POP` instruction 
** pops(loads) the registers in `reg_list` from the stack
** if `ret_val` is included, moves the specified constant value into `a0` as the return value
** adjusts the stack pointer by the `stack_adjustment`.

. `POPRET` has the same behaviour as `POP`, followed by `RET`.

32-bit and 16-bit forms of all instructions are available, the assembler should choose the 16-bit form if the parameters permit.

The registers in `reg_list` and `areg_list` are comma separated lists and must not be empty.

The assembler/disassembler can choose whether to include the `c.` prefix for 16-bit encodings. The recommendation is to exclude it.

[#pushpop32bitsyntax]
==== 32-bit encoding assembler syntax

There are different definitions for the register lists in use (`reg_list_32u/reg_list_16u/reg_list_e`). In all cases the requirements of `areg_list` are the same - and so it is only specified only once with respect to `reg_list_*` to avoid replication.

The stack adjustment range varies between encodings. The syntax `stack_adjustment_0_N` is used. The stack adjustment value must be the total memory required for the registers in `reg_list_*` rounded up to a multiple of 16-bytes, plus an additional 0 to `N` * 16-bytes. Also see <<spimm>>.

Note that if the highest register in `sreg_list_e` is `s2` or lower, then this instruction is a _pseudo-instruction_ for the non `.e` version. If `sreg_list_e` includes `s3` or `s4` then it is a separate encoding.

----

[NOTE]

  An ealier version of the specification allowed `ra` to be excluded from the register list. This caused a lot of complexity in the specifications above and we found very few cases in the benchmark suite where it would have been beneficial. If `ra` is not required then `PUSH/C.PUSH` can still be used, which will waste `XLEN` bits of stack memory but `POP/POPRET` etc. _cannot_ as they would overwrite `ra`

c.popret {ra,s0},{0}, 32;  //load  ra,s0;     increment sp by 32; li a0, 0; jump to ra
c.popret {ra,s0-s3},  96;  //load  ra,s0-s3;  increment sp by 96;           jump to ra
c.popret {ra,s0-s11}, 128; //load  ra,s0-s11; increment sp by 128;          jump to ra

For example

. `c.push   {ra,s0-s2}, {a0-a2},  -64` can use a 16-bit encoding
. `push     {ra,s0-s2},           -64` must use a 32-bit encoding as `{a0-a2}` is excluded
. `push     {ra,s0-s2}, {a0-a2}, -256` can use a 32-bit encoding as the `stack_adjustment` is out of range for `c.push`, or a `c.addi16sp; c.push` sequence achieves the same code-size
. `c.popret {ra,s0-s2}, {0},       32` can use a 16-bit encoding
. `popret   {ra,s0-s2}, {1},       32` must use a 32-bit encoding as `c.popret` only supports `0` as the `ret_val` value

=== Determining XLEN to decode and execute the instructions

The execution of the instructions depends upon `XLEN`, as the width of the loads and stores change. From the ELF file header, the dissembler can determine `XLEN` by the following flags:

* ELFCLASS64 for RV64
* ELFCLASS32 for RV32 

[NOTE]

  I don't think there's an ELFCLASS128 for RV128

If using a debugger then `misa.MXL` can be read, if XLEN is not known for the core.

Follow this link for details of the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md#file-header[ELF file header]

=== Pseudo-code

The pseudo-code below show the required architectural state updates. 

Note that every architectural state update in the pseudo-code can be executed as a standard RISC-V 32-bit encoding, so that it is possible execute the instructions as sequences of standard instructions. 

Because the pseudo-code includes load or store operations, they may take any fault caused by executing loads or stores. See <<fault-handling>> for more details.

==== PUSH/PUSH.E/C.PUSH/C.PUSH.E Pseudo-code

The `PUSH/PUSH.E/C.PUSH/C.PUSH.E` instructions store the set of registers from `reg_list` to consecutive memory locations, and decrement the stack pointer.
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `sw/sd` etc.

The pseudo-code shows the memory and architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  `stack_adjustment` is negative.

==== POP/POP.E/POPRET/POPRET.E/C.POP/C.POP.E/C.POPRET/C.POPRET.E Pseudo-code

A `POP/POP.E/POPRET/POPRET.E/C.POP/C.POP.E/C.POPRET/C.POPRET.E` instruction loads the set of registers from `reg_list` from consecutive memory locations, and then increments the stack pointer. 
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `lw/ld/ret` etc.

The pseudo-code shows the architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

  RV32I may use either the UABI or EABI, so we can only check the EABI minimum alignment.

[#spimm]
==== `spimm` encoding field

The `stack_adjustment` field in the assembler syntax comprises of two components:

. the memory required for the registers in the list, rounded up to 16-bytes (using the `Align16` function below)
. additional stack space allocated for local variables, encoded in the `spimm` field

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
function Align16(i): return (i+15)&~0xf; // make it 16-byte aligned
total_register_bytes = number_of_registers_in_reg_list * XLEN/8;
stack_adjustment = Align16(total_register_bytes) + spimm;
----

the allowable range of `spimm` varies for different encodings.
[NOTE]

  `spimm` always represents 16-byte blocks even on RV32E where the stack is 8-byte aligned. This is for simplicity.

[NOTE]

  if `spimm` is out of range for the compiler, `PUSH/POP/POPRET` can still be inferred, and the compiler can infer an additional stack adjustment instruction

In many cases the 16-bit encoding is sufficient. The 32-bit encoding offers a larger `spimm` range, but this can also be achieved with a separate `c.addi sp, sp, #offset` instruction giving the same overall code-size.

Additional benefits of the 32-bit encoding are:

* more accurate register lists improving performance and memory usage (so that superfluous `s` registers aren't saved/restored)
* better control over the return value (`POP/POPRET`) improving code-size.

[#fault-handling]
=== Fault handling

The sequence required to execute the instruction may be interrupted, or may not be able to start execution for several reasons.

* virtual memory page fault or PMP fault
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution if the memory addresses cross a page/PMP boundary
** `MTVAL` is set to any address which causes the fault
* watchpoint trigger
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution depending on the trigger type (load data triggers require the sequence to have started executing, for example)
** `MTVAL` is set to any address which causes the fault
* external debug halt
** the halt can treat the whole sequence atomically, or interrupt mid sequence (implementation defined)
* debug halt caused by a trigger
** same comment as watchpoint trigger above
* load access fault
** these are detected while the sequence is executing
** `MTVAL` is set to the fault address.
* store access fault (precise or imprecise)
** these may be detected while the sequence is executing, or afterwards if imprecise
** `MTVAL` is set to the fault address.
* interrupts
** these may arrive at any time. An implementation can choose whether to interrupt the sequence or not.

In all case `MEPC` contain the `PC` of the `PUSH/POP` instruction, and `MCAUSE` is set as expected for the type of fault.

For debug halts `DPC` is set to the `PC` of the `PUSH/POP` instruction.

Because some faults can only be detected during the sequence the core implementation is able to recover from the fault and re-execute the sequence. This may involve executing some or all of the loads and stores from the sequence multiple times before the sequence completes (as multiple faults or multiple interrupts are possible).

Therefore correct execution requires that `sp` refers to idempotent memory (see <<non-idem-mem>> for non-idempotent handling)

[#software-view]
=== Software view of execution

==== Software view of `PUSH` sequence

From a software perspective the `PUSH` sequence appears as:

* A sequence of stores writing a contiguous block of memory. Any of the bytes may be written multiple times.
* A stack pointer adjustment

Because the memory is idempotent and the stores are non-overlapping, they may be reordered, grouped into larger accesses, split into smaller access or any combination of these.

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, and the interrupt handler uses `sp` to allocate stack memory, then any stores which were executed before the interrupt maybe be overwritten by the handler. This is safe because the memory is idempotent and the stores will be re-executed once the handler completes.

The stack pointer adjustment must only be committed once it is certain that all of the stores will complete within triggerring any precise faults (stores may return imprecise bus errors which are received after the instruction has completed execution).

For example:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
c.push  {ra, s0-s5},{a0-a3}, -64
----

Appears to software as:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
# any bytes from SP-1 to SP-28 may be written multiple times before the instruction completes
sw  ra, -4(sp);   
sw  s0, -8(sp);   
sw  s1,-12(sp);   
sw  s2,-16(sp);  
sw  s3,-20(sp);   
sw  s4,-24(sp);   
sw  s5,-28(sp);   

# these must only execute once, and will only execute after all stores complete sucessfully
mv s0, a0;
mv s1, a1;
mv s2, a2;
mv s3, a3;
addi sp, sp, -64; 
----

==== Software view of `POP/POPRET` sequence

From a software perspective the `POP/POPRET` sequence appears as:

* A sequence of loads, any of which may be executed multiple times
* A stack pointer adjustment
* An optional `RET`

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, then any loads which were executed before the interrupt may update architectural state. The loads will be re-executed once the handler completes, so the values will be overwritten. Therefore it is permitted for an implementation to update some of the destination registers before taking the interrupt or other fault.

The register moves and stack pointer adjustment must only be committed once it is certain that all of the loads will complete successfully.

For `POPRET` once the stack pointer adjustment has been committed the `RET` must execute.

For example:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
popret   {ra, s0-s3}, {1}, 32 ; 
----

Appears to software as:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
# any or all of these load instructions may execute multiple times
lw   ra, 28(sp);
lw   s0, 24(sp);
lw   s1, 20(sp);
lw   s2, 16(sp);
lw   s3, 12(sp);

# must only execute once, will only execute after all loads complete successfully
# all instructions must execute atomically
li a0, 1
addi sp, sp, 32;
ret;
----
[[non-idem-mem]]
==== Non-idempotent memory

An implementation may have a requirement to issue `PUSH/POP/POPRET` to non-idempotent memory. 

==== Error detection

If the core implementation does not have a requirement to support `PUSH/POP/POPRET` to non-idempotent memories, and the core can use a PMA to detect that the memory is non-idempotent, then take a load(`POP/POPRET`) or store (`PUSH`) access fault exception.

==== Non-idempotent support

It is possible to support non-idempotent memory. One reason is to re-use `PUSH/POP` as a restricted form of a load/store multiple instruction to a peripheral (see <<ldstm>>), as there is no generic load/store multiple instruction currently in the RISC-V ISA. If load/store multiple is supported in the future then it should support non-idempotent memory.

If accessing non-idempotent memory then it is _recommended_ to:

. Not allow interrupts during execution
. Not allow external debug halt during execution
. Detect any virtual memory page faults or PMP faults for the whole instruction before starting execution (instead of during the sequence)
. Not split / merge / reorder the generated memory accesses

It is possible that one of the following will still occur during execution:

. Watchpoint trigger
. Load/store access fault

In these cases the core will jump to the debug or exception handler. If execution is required to continue afterwards (so the event is not fatal to the code execution), then the handler is required to do so in software. 

By following these rules memory accesses will only ever be issued once, and in the order listed in the pseudo-code.

It is possible for implementations to follow these restricted rules and to safely access both types of memory. It is also possible for an implementation to use PMAs to detect the memory type and apply different rules, such as only allowing interrupts if accessing cacheable memory, for example.

=== Toolchain implementation

`PUSH/POP/POPRET` can be generated by the compiler, but can also be added as an optimisation in the linker. If they are inferred at link time then they can also be used to optimise precompiled library code. This means that the libraries can be shipped without these instructions, but platforms which implement them can still benefit from the code-size saving.

[NOTE]

  The linker may have to reallocate registers as the register moves included in `PUSH/C.PUSH` target specific `s` registers which may not agree with the compiler output, example.

==== Compiling for size or performance

There are cases where it is not clear whether to use the 16-bit or 32-bit encoding.

If compiling with -Os/-Oz the compiler should generate the smallest possible code output, which may include performance reduction due to:

1. too many `s` registers in the register list
.. for example `push {ra, s0-s6}` is required but not available in the 16-bit encoding so `c.push {ra,s0-s7}` must be used instead for the smallest code-size
2. too many included register moves (for `C.PUSH` only)
.. for example `push {ra,s0-s1}, {a0}` is required, but the 16-bit encoding will include an extra register move `c.push {ra,s0-s1}, {a0-a1}`

Another consideration is whether the total stack adjustment can be encoded by the 16-bit version, the 32-bit encoding gives a larger range but still will not cover all cases.

The default choice is always to use the 16-bit encoding. The rules below are for when to choose the 32-bit encoding instead.

For `C.PUSH/PUSH`, use `PUSH` if:

1. The total stack adjustment (see <<#total-stack-rv32>>, <<total-stack-rv64>>) is out of range for `C.PUSH`, but in range for `PUSH`.
2. `C.PUSH` includes too many `s` registers and not compiling with -Os/-Oz.
3. `C.PUSH` includes too many register moves and not compiling with -Os/-Oz.

For `C.POPRET/POPRET`, use `POPRET` if:

1. The total stack adjustment (see <<#total-stack-rv32>>, <<total-stack-rv64>>) is out of range for `C.POPRET`, but in range for `POPRET`.
2. `C.POPRET` includes too many `s` registers and not compiling with -Os/-Oz.
3. The return value is `1` or `-1`, (`C.POPRET` only allows the option of returning `0`).

For `C.POP/POP`, use `POP` if

1. The total stack adjustment (see <<#total-stack-rv32>>, <<total-stack-rv64>>) is out of range for `C.POP`, but in range for `POP`.
2. The return value is `0, 1` or `-1`.

_Example 1_ The 16-bit encoding includes too many register moves.

_Example 3_ The register list doesn't match the 16-bit encoding, and the 32-bit encoding allows inclusion of the return value.

In this case the 16-bit encoding is inferior in the epilogue - because it includes `s7` and cannot include the `mv, a0, s0`. Therefore the 32-bit encoding uses the correct register list and has the same code size.

This requires that `sp` is saved before and restored after the sequence.  It may also require that interrupts are disbled if the interrupt handler allocates space using `sp`, as the `sp` will not point to the stack during the sequence.

Also `POP` can be used to replace the equivalent series of loads. 

Even though there is not much code-size saving once the `sp` save/restore code has been included, and the restricted memory layout targetted by the instructions, there may be a performance benefit to doing this for small embedded cores. A load/store-multiple sequence may be issued to the peripheral bus as a single burst instead of multiple single accesses which individually require arbitration. In some cases this can save one or more cycles per access as the arbiter remains locked to the core until the sequence has completed.

If the target memory is non-idempotent then see <<non-idem-mem>> for additional constraints.

=== Appendix: Benchmarking PUSH/POP against -msave-restore

`PUSH/POP` are benchmarked relative to `-msave-restore`, which is available in GCC and more recently also available in LLVM 13. To give more realistic benchmarking results, the save routines have embedded moves added (see below), and are otherwise unchanged from GCC10.

The restore routines are unchanged, and always include `ret` at the end. This means that tail call optimisation is disabled when using `msave-restore`, which can have a large performance impact (which is solved by using `C.POP`). Realistically, a second set of routines without `RET` are needed to allow tail call optimisation.

The cost of each call to the save/restore routines varies. If `C.TBLJALM/C.TBLJ` are used then it is _always_ 16-bits. If not, then the call to save will be 32 or 64-bit (`C.JAL` can't link to `t0`). The call to the restore routine can be 16-bit (`C.J`), 32-bit (`J`) or 64-bit (`AUIPC; JR`).

Clearly the code-size will be considerably smaller if all calls use `C.TBLJALM/CLTBLJ`.

==== Benchmarking configuration 1

Configuration 1 uses the save/restore code above, and does not use `C.TBLJALM/C.TBLJ`.
It will *not* call a save/restore routine if only `ra` is saved/restored.

==== Benchmarking configuration 2

Configuration 2 uses the save/restore code above, and uses `C.TBLJALM/C.TBLJ`, so every call is 16-bits.
It will *not* call a save/restore routine if only `ra` is saved/restored.

==== Performance analysis

Performance is expected to be significantly higher using PUSH/POP than the software routines. Unnecessary jumps are eliminated, and redundant loads/stores are minimised. Additionally `C.POP` allows tail call optimisation to be enabled.

[NOTE]

  We should do some performance analysis to show the benefit vs `-msave-restore`. Details TBD.

== Compiler switches

If `Zcea/Zceb/Zcee` are specified, then the compiler will include all the instructions from the relevant subsets.
It is also useful to be able to select instructions in a more fine-grained way to help with benchmarking and analysis work, especially when analysing the results of the prototype compiler.
Therefore the compiler switches in <<compilerswitches>> are available, each one is used to enable a specific list of instructions.

== Verification notes

=== Existing functionality

Many of the instructions are 16-bit encodings of existing 32-bit instructions, therefore the verification should be a simple extension to existing tests and coverage. Additionally, the instructions are all very simple.
. C.SEXT.B, C.SEXT.H, (C.SEXT.W is a pseudo-instruction)
. C.ZEXT.B, C.ZEXT.H, C.ZEXT.W
. C.MUL, C.NOT, C.NEG
. C.LBU, C.LHU, C.LB, C.LH, C.SB, C.SH

=== Simple extensions to existing functionality

These instructions are extremely similar to existing instructions, so the verification tests and coverage should be a simple extension from existing tests and coverage:

. BEQI, BNEI
.. these are immediate forms of BEQ and BNE, they compare a register value against an immediate instead of two register values
. LWGP
.. this have the same functionality as LW, but the base register is explicitly GP and the immediate offset range is larger
. SWGP
.. this have the same functionality as SW, but the base register is explicitly GP and the immediate offset range is larger
. MULI
.. same as MUL with a signed immediate operand

=== New branch functionality

`DECBNEZ` and `C.DECBNEZ` are also fused versions of two instructions:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
decbnez  s2, 1, -48
----

is equivalent to:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
addi s2, s2, -1
bnez s2, -48
----

Therefore the coverage is the same as for `ADDI/BGEZ` combined, noting the limited range of subtraction values (1,2,4,8) and the range of the branch offset (especially for `C.DECBNEZ`).

=== Sequenced functionality

`PUSH/POP/POPRET` execute a sequence of micro-ops to execute the whole instruction. As a result they are considerably more complex to verify than the other instructions.

==== Cover all possible sets of operands

`mv, rlist, ra, spimm` are all fields in the encoding.

| C.POPRET    | `rlist`(0 to 7) x `ret_val` (0 to 1) x `spimm` (0 to 7) | 128
|==============================================================================

==== Test the functionality

Execution of every PUSH/POP/POPRET instruction must result in the same architectural state updates as executing the sequence that it expands into. For example:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
popret   {ra, s0-s3}, {1}, 32; 
----

causes identical architectural state updates to the expanded sequence:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
lw   ra, 28(sp);
lw   s0, 24(sp);
lw   s1, 20(sp);
lw   s2, 16(sp);
lw   s3, 12(sp);
li   a0, 1
addi sp, sp, 32;
ret
----

Therefore a suggestion is to generate pairs of tests, one with the expanded sequences and one with `PUSH/POP/POPRET`. Each test must give identical results, including having the same contents in the memory.

It is also possible to introduce

. interrupts
. debug triggers on the loads/stores in the sequence
. external debug halts
. load/store access faults due to bus errors or PMP faults
. load/store page faults

on the loads and stores in the sequence. `mepc` will be different between the two tests but `mcause` and `mtval` must match. Note that interrupts and external debug halts are asynchronous events, so to make the results from the two tests match then the handler must not (for example) count the number of interrupts taken.

Implementations may choose for the sequences to be uninterruptible, or to be interruptible and to restart after the `mret`. The overall result is the same - the sequence will eventually complete and correctly update the architectural state, providing any debug triggers are disabled in the handler before resuming execution (so they don't trigger again)

==== Table jump, jump table mode only

Table jump is quite simple architecturally. 

`c.tblj* n;` references memory address `m = InstMemory[xTBLJALVEC + n * XLEN/8]`

The core jumps to address `m`, and links to the relevant link register.

For verification we must show that the different link registers work and that the core jumps to the correct location each time.

== Rejected and postponed instructions

=== Not benchmarked: PUSH.[FDQ], POP.[FDQ], POPRET.[FDQ]

Please read <<pushpoppopret>> before reading this section.

These instructions are variants of `PUSH/POP/POPRET` which also allow `F` registers to be saved/restored.

==== Assembler Syntax

These instructions require a register list including `fs` registers.

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
<fsreg_list> ::= <ra> "," <sreg_range> ", " <freg_range> | <ra> "," <freg_range> | <sreg_range> "," <freg_range> | <freg_range>
<rfsreg_list> ::= <ra> "," <sreg_range> ", " <freg_range> | <ra> "," <freg_range>
<freg_range> ::= <fs0> | <fs0-fsM> (valid values of M are 1,2,3,5,8,11)

//legal syntax

push.[fdq]   {<fsreg_list>},     -stack_adjustment
pop.[fdq]    {<fsreg_list>},      stack_adjustment
popret.[fdq] {<rfsreg_list>},     stack_adjustment //popret must include ra

----

To be a legal encoding:

1.  The total stack adjustment must be negative for `PUSH.[FDQ]` and positive for `POP.[FDQ]/POPRET.[FDQ]`
2.  The total stack adjustment must be in range (see <<spimm>>) and must be a multiple of 16
3.  The register lists must be valid (see above)
7.  For `POPRET.[FDQ]`, `rfsreg_list` must include `ra`

Additionally:

. If `sp` is not 16-byte aligned then take a load (`PUSH.[FDQ]`) or store (`POP.[FDQ]/POPRET.[FDQ]`) address misaligned exception, and do not issue any loads or stores.

[NOTE]
  When moving from loading or storing `x` registers to `f` registers there may be a gap as the registers may be different widths, and all registers must be aligned in memory

===== Rationale: why include the .[fdq] suffix

It is required to hard-code the length of the `f` registers in the opcode, and not just save/restore the whole register. We must allow code compiled for the F-extension
to run on a  core which supports D and possibly Q. We must also allow code compiled for the D-extension to run on a core which supports Q.

If we don't explicitly state the `f` register width and always store the whole register, then the registers will be stored at different addresses to the ones expected 
by the compiler. 

An alternative would be to use `misa.[FDQ]`
to directly control the behaviour and so set `misa.[DQ]=0` when running F code. Nothing else in the architecture requires this, so it seems unreasonable to 
add this requirement here. This approach also wouldn't work for `Z[FDQ]inx` cores as `misa.[FDQ]` are all hardwired to zero.

==== Pseudo-code

The pseudo-code below show the required architectural state updates. 

Note that every architectural state update in the pseudo-code can be executed as a standard RISC-V 32-bit encoding, so that it is possible execute the instructions as sequences of standard instructions. 

Because the pseudo-code includes load or store operations, they may take any fault caused by executing loads or stores. See <<fault-handling>> for more details.

===== PUSH.[FDQ] Pseudo-code

The `PUSH.FDQ` instruction stores the set of registers from `fsreg_list` to consecutive memory locations, and decrements the stack pointer.
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `fsw/fsd` etc.

The pseudo-code shows the memory and architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  `stack_adjustment` is negative.

----

===== POP.[FDQ]/POPRET/[FDQ] Pseudo-code

A `POP/POPRET` instruction loads the set of registers from `fsreg_list` from consecutive memory locations, and then increments the stack pointer. 
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `flw/fld/ret`.

The pseudo-code shows the architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  bits [23:22] are the `fdq` field
  
[NOTE]
  `ra=1` for all `popret` encodings, it is not specified in the encoding


===== Illegal instructions 

The encoding takes the same behaviour as any floating point instruction if executed when disabled:

* if `frlist>0` and `misa.F==0`
* if `frlist>0` and `fdq==1` and `misa.D==0`
* if `frlist>0` and `fdq==2` and `misa.Q==0`

The following cases do not decode as `PUSH*/POP*/POPRET*`

* No registers are specified (`rlist, frlist` are both zero)
* `rlist>14`
* `fdq=3`
* `rlist==13` and `frlist>0` and the opcode doesn't have an `[fdq]` suffix

===== Rational: `rlist=13, frlist=0` saving all saved registers

The debian distro does save all `s` and `fs` registers on a few occasions, so there is a special encoding for this case. I saw no justification for saving all `fs` registers *without* saving all `s` registers. It seems useful to have a form which saves all saved registers.

The programmable range for `frlist` doesn't save many `fs` registers as `FPMark` only saves one or two and Debian rarely saves more than that.

`n` is an integer in the tables so `2n` is always even, `2n+1` is always odd.

=== Benchmarking results too low

==== TBLJAL (32-bit encoding)

`TBLJAL` offers minimal additional benefit over `C.TBLJAL`

  The 32-bit encoding is in _custom-0_, correct encodings need to be allocated.

==== LWTP, SWTP, LDTP, SDTP

TP relative load/store (similar to LWGP etc.) adding TP as a second global pointer.

The benefit from LWGP etc. so far is very low so there is no justification to add an extended range to TP.

==== MULIADD, ADDIADD, MULIW, MULIADDW, ADDIADDW

These instructions have low benefit. `MULIADD` and `ADDIADD` are unpopular due to requiring 3 operands. `MULI` is useful (and is included in the proposal) and takes much of the benefit of `MULIADD`

See https://github.com/clairexen/riscv-fanfic/blob/master/riscv-cfmt/riscv-cfmt.md[Clare's proposal from the B-extension].

== Future ideas

=== Multiple move instructions

These instructions have some problems: 

. They either two register file write ports, or to be issued in a sequence.
. C.MVA* use ABI names when specifying source registers, which is efficient but non-standard
. There is no 32-bit encoding which makes sense, because each does the work of 2 x 16-bit encodings

Therefore ratification is delayed, and some more thought is needed.

==== C.MVP

The generic move uses standard x register numbers, and so it more standard than `C.MVA*S07`, however it takes a lot more encoding space. Both register pairs must be even/odd pairs (`rdp[0]=0, rsp[0]=0`) to reduce the encoding space requirement.

[NOTE]

  Currently there are no 32-bit equivalent instructions, is it enough to expand to *two* 32-bit instructions?

[NOTE]

  These are optional (`Zces`) as they require 2 register file write ports, or are sequenced.
